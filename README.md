## This assignment was really fun! I enjoyed learning and watching the capabilities js & jquery have to offer!

The Website will let you type out any task yous have laid out throughout your day and depending on the time of day your tasks will change color green indicating future tasks left & red to indicate late or tasks in past time. Everything will save to localStorage so reload the page as much as you'd like! here is a screenshot of the page: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101440634/171994834-4103e3a2-1971-46ae-8ace-8ce7c4916f17.png)
